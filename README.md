**MRA** is created to explore movies and also it helps to rent.

ðŸ’¡ I would say that film is vital to society. Weâ€™ve all watched movies or comedy programs such as The Simpsons, South Park, and Family Guy. Yes, these are fictional shows, but they can be influential to some people. They have pushed the envelope of what is acceptable in television, and many people worldwide love them. But I think film is so vital to society because it gives us a chance to reflect on our own lives and the lives of others who are different and can offer us a new perspective on life.

## Story :book:

MRA - Movie Rental App was born out of need to explore movies of different catagories and to rent. It helps an individual to view/explore a set of movies based on their favorite /likes and selection. This project would enable artists to extend their reach and gain new viewer. End Users would be movie explorer, movie trailer creators, movie rental provider and movie advertisers.  User preference is still needed, hence the project revolves around the end user based on their input and preferences.
